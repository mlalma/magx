# Magx-Panel-Test

Test application for the floating panel component. Install and run the application:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

The application will be available on localhost URL ```http://localhost:5173```.

The default application shows how to declaratively create a floating panel and how to react to value changes such as changing out-of-bounds check based on checbox value or changing the panel's background color based on the color on color picker.

Second example shows how to build a new panel programmatically. The corresponding code is on files ```programmatic-panel.html``` and ```src/ProgrammaticExamplePanel.ts```. The example is available on localhost URL ```http://localhost:5173/programmatic-panel.html``` when Vite dev server is running (```npm run dev```).
